The Order Filler has now scheduled two additional SPS for IVUS and XA.
 These were triggered by a PPS from the first modality in the Cath
 Workflow (HD).

Test 20102 now sends a new MWL query to the Order Filler to
 determine if the new SPS are on the worklist. This query
 happens before the MPPS complete message from the first modality,
 so there should be entries for three modalities (HD, IVUS, XA).
