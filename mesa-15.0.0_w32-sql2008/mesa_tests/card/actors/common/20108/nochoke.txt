20108- 

At this point in this test case, the hemo modality 
in Cath Lab #2 has successfully performed a broad query
to the OF and found the original patient.  The hemo then 
sent an MPPS In Progress message.  The DSS/OF then created
the necessary SPS for that room and the XA queried those SPS 
using DMWL.  At this point, verify that the OF database is 
in fact accurate.  The rest of the transactions are tested 
elsewhere.  20108 effectively completed.
