In test 20108, the procedure is seemingly still in progress
in Room 1.  Meanwhile, the physician has decided, for whatever reason
(e.g, equipment failure or change from diagnostic to interventional),
to move the procedure from Room 1 to Room 2.   The procedure is not yet
closed out in Room 1 (no MPPS from  modalities).

The Order Filler is about to receive a broad DICOM MWL query from 
an Acquisition Modality in Room 2.

Then an MPPS in Progress Message (CARD-1) will be sent from the 
Acquisition Modality to the Order Filler from Room 2.

The Order Filler will be expected to schedule procedure
steps for the remaining equipment in the room with the
expectation that those SPS will be needed before there
is time to place an order for the corresponding procedures.

The Order Filler will need to schedule two SPS, one for an IVUS
modality and the second for an XA:
 XX-20012/LAB7_IVUS/IVUS
 XX-20013/LAB7_XA/XA
