Test:  20710
Title: Stress ECG Option -- 12-Lead ECG Waveform

Test Case 20710 is for Acquisition Modalities which have implemented 
the Stress ECG Option of the Stress Testing Workflow Integration 
Profile (STRESS) and are capable of sending DICOM 12-LEAD ECG Waveform 
objects.

This tests the Stress workflow - you will be asked to query for MWL and use the MESA 
tools to collect DICOM 12-Lead ECG Waveform objects.
This test verifies that the Patient ID and Study Instance UID from the MWL is encoded.  
The Waveform objects will be also evaluated for attributes required for the [CARD-2] 
transaction when the Stress ECG option is supported . This test verifies that the 
attributes are present and that defined codes and values are used, but cannot check 
that the defined attributes are accurate (ie., that a given waveform was acquired using 
the Pharmacologic protocol, or during the Resting state).  That exercise is left to the
vendors to test internally.

The next steps registers the patient for this test, and places and schedules
an order.
