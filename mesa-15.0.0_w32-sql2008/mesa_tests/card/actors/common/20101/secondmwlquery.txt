The Order Filler has now scheduled one additional SPS that
was triggered by a PPS from the first modality in the Cath
Workflow.

Test 20101 now sends a new MWL query to the Order Filler to
determine if the new SPS is on the worklist. This query
happens before the MPPS complete message from the first modality,
so there should still be entries for both modalities.
