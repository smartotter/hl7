In test 20101, the Order Filler is about to receive the MPPS
in Progress Message (CARD-1) from the Acquisition Modality.
The Order Filler will be expected to schedule procedure
steps for the remaining equipment in the room with the
expectation that those SPS will be needed before there
is time to place an order for the corresponding procedures.

The Order Filler will be sent the MPPS in Progress Message and then
prompted to perform the scheduling in the next step.

The Order Filler will need to schedule two SPS, one for an IVUS
modality and the second for an XA:
 XX-20012/LAB7_IVUS/IVUS
 XX-20013/LAB7_XA/XA
