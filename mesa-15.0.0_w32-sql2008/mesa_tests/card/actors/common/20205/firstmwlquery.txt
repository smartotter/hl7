The Order Filler has received a PPS from a modality for which it 
has no scheduled procedure.  This indicates that it is Case C5.
The Order Filler is now responsible for creating and scheduling a 
procedure using the Study Instance UID and the procedure codes that 
it received in the initial Modality PPS.

Test 20205 now expects the first MWL query from the SECOND MODALITY 
to go to the Order Filler.  There should now be an SPS entry on the 
worklist. This query happens before the MPPS complete message from 
the first modality, so there should still be entries for both modalities.
