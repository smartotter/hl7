The Order Filler has received an ADT message with a permanent ID.
The patient was originally processed with a temporary ID assigned
by the Order Filler. In the next step, the Order Filler merges
the temporary ID with the permanent ID and sends an HL7 message
to the Image Manager indicating the merge.
