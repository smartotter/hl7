The Order Filler has received a PPS from a modality for which it
has no scheduled procedure.  This indicates that it is Case C5.
The Order Filler is now responsible for creating and scheduling a
procedure using the Study Instance UID and the procedure codes that
it received in the initial Modality PPS. The OF will send a 
RAD-4 (Procedure Scheduled) message to the Image Manager to notify 
the IM of the newly created procedure.
