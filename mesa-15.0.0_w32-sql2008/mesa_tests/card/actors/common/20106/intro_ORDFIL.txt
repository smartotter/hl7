Your Order Filler need to assign a temporary Patient Name and temporary
Patient ID. This name/ID is owned by the DSS/Order Filler and will be used
at the modality during acquisition. Later, you will receive an ADT message
with the permanent name/identifier, and you will merge your identifier
with the permanent identifier.
