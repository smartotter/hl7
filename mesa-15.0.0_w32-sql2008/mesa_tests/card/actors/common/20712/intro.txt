Title: 20712: Stress ECG Option -- General ECG Waveform

Test Case 20712 is for Acquisition Modalities which have implemented 
the Stress ECG Option of the Stress Testing Workflow Integration 
Profile (STRESS) and are capable of sending DICOM General ECG Waveform 
objects.

In this test, you use the MESA tools to collect DICOM General ECG Waveform objects.  
This test verifies that the Patient ID and Study Instance UID from the MWL is encoded.  
The Wavform objects will be also evaluated for attributes required for the [CARD-2] 
transaction when the Stress ECG option is supported . This test verifies that the 
attributes are present and that defined codes and values are used, but cannot check 
that the defined attributes are accurate (ie., that a given waveform was acquired using 
the Pharmacologic protocol, or during the Resting state).  That exercise is left to the
vendors to test internally.
