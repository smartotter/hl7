This next (indented) part of the introduction is intended only
for Patient Demographic Suppliers:
 This script assumes you have loaded demographics into
 your server with a separate step. If you do not have
 the proper demographics loaded in your server, please
 exit this script and load those demographics.

 To use MESA scripts:
      perl scripts/pds_pdq.pl 11300 1

 You can also load the demographics by hand. You are
 not required to use the MESA scripts.

Test 11365 will now proceed.
