This is ITI test 10506.

It is designed to test the PIX Integretation Profile.
In this test, a patient is registered in two domains
with different demographics. The Cross Reference Manager
is queried for a cross reference (and should indicate none).
The demographics are then updated/syncrhonized so that the
Cross Reference Manager should link these two patient records.
Another query is sent to the Cross Reference Manager.
