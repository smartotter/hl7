This is ITI test 12102.

It is designed to test the PAM Integretation Profile.
In this test, the Patient Demographic Source creates a new
patient and sends the new patient transaction (ITI-30) to
the Patient Demographics Consumer. The patient then has a name
change (patient marries), and the Patient Demographic Source
sends an update message (ITI-30, ADT A31) to notify the the
Patient Demographic Consumer.

Two messages are sent in this test.
