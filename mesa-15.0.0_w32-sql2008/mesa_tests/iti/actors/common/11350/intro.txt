This next (indented) part of the introduction is intended only
for Patient Demographic Suppliers:
  This script assumes you have loaded demographics into
  your server with a separate step. If you do not have
  the proper demographics loaded in your server, please
  exit this script and load those demographics.

  To use MESA scripts:
    perl scripts/pds_pdq.pl 11300 1

  You can also load the demographics by hand. You are
  not required to use the MESA scripts.

Test 11350 will now proceed.
