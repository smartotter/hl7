==== This text is intended for Evidence Creator actors only.
     Other actors should ignore this text.

In this next step, the Evidence Creator should take the two
series it received for this test 3540 and properly blend the images.
For example, this may require setting the Rescale Intercept & Slope, 
or LUT, and modifying the Opacity of the superimposed series. 

The test makers do not have the final parameters for the BSPS object.
