Test Case 100: MWL Tests for Order Filler
This test is designed specifically for an Order Filler to exercise Modality
Worklist functions.  Order Fillers will need to have proper responses to MWL 
queries to complete the remaining tests.  The steps are documented here for 
consistency with other tests.
