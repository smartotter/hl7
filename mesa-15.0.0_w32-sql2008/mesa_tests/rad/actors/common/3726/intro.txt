If you import DICOM objects from digital media (eg CD) or via the network, 
you should run test 3725 instead.

-------

Test 3726 involves transactions for the Scheduled Patient Management Option
for Importers in the Import Reconciliation Workflow which import by
digitizing film or documents. Ensure that a film or document is available to
scan prior to starting this test.  

For this test, you should assume:
  - the original Patient Name on the scanned film/document is VIOLET^V
  - the original Patient ID on the scanned film/document is 9999
You will be expected to include these values in the Modified Attributes
Sequence (0400,0550).

The next step in the test will give the Patient Name and Patient ID
that will appear in the MWL for data to be imported. 

Use the data from the MWL entry as new values in the imported object 
you will C-STORE during this test.
