Test: 3740
Title: 3740: IRWF Exception Management - abandoned import (scheduled)

References:
 RAD TF-3:4.60.4.1.2.2

This test is for Importers which support the Scheduled Import Option.  If you 
support the Unscheduled Import option, you should run test 3739 instead.

Test Case 3740 involves transactions for PPS EXCEPTION MANAGEMENT in the
Import Reconciliation Workflow when the Importer abandons the import after
the PPS In Progress message has been sent.  This test requires the
Importer actor to import DICOM objects from media provided with the
MESA tools, or to digitize films or documents.  Ensure that this media is 
available prior to starting this test.

The next step in the test will give the Patient Name and Patient ID
that will appear in the MWL for data to be imported.  Use the 
data from the MWL entry to coerce the data prior to C-store.
