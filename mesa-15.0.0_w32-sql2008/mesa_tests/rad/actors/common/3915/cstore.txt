Create one Mammography image which encodes Partial View in (0028,1350) and
the Partial View Code Sequence (0028,1352).  These attributes are evaluated
in this test.

The Patient ID should be MESA3915. The patient name should be MESA^Mammo3915. 
These values are not critical to the test.

You should now C-STORE [RAD-8] this Mammography image to the MESA Image Manager.
