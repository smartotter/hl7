If your modality is a digitizer, you should run 3905 instead.

In test 3900, you will be prompted to C-STORE a pair of "For Presentation" 
and "For Processing" mammography images.  The evaluation script verifies that 
data attributes required by this profile are present in these objects, and 
that the "For Presentatiom" image references the "For Processing" image
in the Source Image Sequence (0008,2112).


Storage Commitment N-ACTION may be sent, but it will not be evaluated
in this test.
