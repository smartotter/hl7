You should create a pair of "For Presentation" and "For Processing"
mammography images. The Patient ID should be MESA3900.  The patient name 
should be MESA^Mammo3900. These values are not critical to the test.

You should now C-STORE [RAD-8] both Mammography images to the MESA 
Image Manager.  It does not matter which is sent first.
