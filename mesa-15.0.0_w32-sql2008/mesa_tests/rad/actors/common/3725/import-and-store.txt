The Importer actor should now import the DICOM objects for 
test 3725 from the test CD provided with the MESA distribution. 
If this has already been accomplished, there is no need to 
repeat that step.

The Importer should also coerce the data in preparation for
export. New information for patient VIOLET^V comes from 
the response to the MWL query.

The map for coercing attributes is found in
RAD TF-2: Appendix A (A.2).

After coercing attributes as required, store the study to the 
MESA Image Manager/Archive.
