Test Case 3725 involves transactions for the Scheduled Import Option
for Importers from digital media (eg CD) in the Import Reconciliation Workflow. 
This test requires the Importer Actor to a import DICOM study from
media provided  with the MESA tools. Ensure that this media is available
prior to starting this test. Use the patient with Patient ID 3725XXX on
the CD. There will be one series of images with 18 slices.

If you import scanned film or documents, you should run test 3726 instead. 

The next step in the test will give the Patient Name and Patient ID
that will appear in the MWL for data to be imported. The name on the MWL
might not match the patient name for Patient ID 3725XXX on the CD. That is
part of the test; use the data from the MWL entry to coerce the data
from the CD.
