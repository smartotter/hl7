The next two transactions are used to send two series
to the Evidence Creator. This data is supplied here 
using a C-STORE, but can alternatively be copied to 
the Evidence Creator from the CD/DVD provided with 
the MESA tools. 

If the Evidence Creator already the SOP instances or 
wants to read from the CD, skip the next two C-STORE steps 
(enter 's' at the prompt).
