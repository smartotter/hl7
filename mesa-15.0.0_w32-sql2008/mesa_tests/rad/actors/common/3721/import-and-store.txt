The Importer actor should now scan one film or document for 
test 3721.  If this has already been accomplished, there is 
no need to repeat that step.

The Importer should also coerce the data in preparation
for export. New information for patient YELLOW^Y comes from 
the response to the PDQ query. Please use the proper identification.

After coercing attributes as required, store the study to the 
MESA Image Manager/Archive.
