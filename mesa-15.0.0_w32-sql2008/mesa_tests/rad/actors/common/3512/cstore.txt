The next two transactions are used to send two series
to the Evidence Creator. This data is supplied here 
using a C-STORE, but can alternatively be copied to 
the Evidence Creator from the MESA Storage FUSION/3512
images provided with the MESA tools. 

If the Evidence Creator already has the SOP instances or 
wants to read from the CD, skip the next two C-STORE steps.
