Title: 3720: Importer (portable media) Coerces Attributes - Unscheduled Import Option

References:
 Import Reconciliation Workflow -- RAD TF-1: 21.3.1.3 and RAD TF-2: Appendix A.2

Test Case 3720 involves transactions for the Unscheduled Import Option
for Importers from digital media (eg CD) in the Import Reconciliation Workflow. 
This test requires the Importer actor to import a DICOM study from media 
provided with the MESA tools. Ensure that this media is available prior
to starting this test.    

If you import scanned film or documents, you should run test 3721 instead.
