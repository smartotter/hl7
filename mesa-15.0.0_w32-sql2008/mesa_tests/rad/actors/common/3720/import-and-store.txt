The Importer actor should now import the DICOM objects for 
test 3720 from the test CD provided with the MESA distribution. 
If this has already been accomplished, there is no need to 
repeat that step.

The Importer should also coerce the data in preparation for
export. New information for patient GOLDENROD^G comes from 
the response to the PDQ query. Please use the proper identification.

After coercing attributes as required, store the study to the 
MESA Image Manager/Archive.
