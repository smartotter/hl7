Test: 3739
Title: 3739: IRWF Exception Management - abandoned import (unscheduled)

References:
 RAD TF-3:4.60.4.1.2.2

This test is for Importers which support the Unscheduled Import Option.  If you support the Scheduled Import option, you should run test 3740 instead.

Test Case 3739 involves transactions for PPS EXCEPTION MANAGEMENT in the Import Reconciliation Workflow when the Importer abandons the import after the PPS In Progress message has been sent.  

This test requires the Importer actor to query the Patient Demographic Supplier for patient data, then import DICOM objects from media provided with the MESA tools, or to digitize a film or document. Ensure that this media is available prior to starting this test.
