Carefully follow these instructions.  A summary of the activities is:
	1. import objects
	2. coerce attributes
	3. begin storing DICOM objects to MESA Image Manager;
		store at least one object
	4. discontinue storing before all images are sent

INSTRUCTIONS:

(1) The Importer actor should now import the DICOM objects for 
test 3739.  If you are a digitizer, scan two films or documents.
If you import from CD or network, import the DICOM objects for test 3739 
from the test CD provided with the MESA distribution. If this 
has already been accomplished, there is no need to repeat that step.

(2) The Importer should also coerce the data in preparation for
export. New information for patient PEACH^P comes from 
the response to the Patient Demographic Supplier.

(3) After coercing attributes as required, C-STORE one image/object
to the MESA Image Manager/Archive.  Do not store the entire study.

(4) Discontinue storing before the study is completely sent.
