Test:  3742
Title: 3742 - IRWF Exception Management - incorrect worklist item (scheduled)

This test is for Importers which support the Scheduled Import Option.

This tests the behavior of the Importer when the operator realizes, after storing one
object to the Image Manager, that the wrong item was selected from the worklist
received from the DSS/OF.  

After the PPS is discontinued, the Importer will re-query the DSS/OF for the correct
patient, reconcile the imported objects with this patient information, and store them to the Image Manager.  

The next step in the test will display the Patient Name and Patient ID
that will appear in the MWL for data to be imported. 
The first Patient listed (Patient ID=3799) will be for the incorrect worklist item. The second Patient listed (Patient ID=3742) will be for the correct worklist item .
