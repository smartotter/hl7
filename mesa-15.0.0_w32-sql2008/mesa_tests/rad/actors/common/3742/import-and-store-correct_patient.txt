Carefully follow these instructions.  The sequence of activities is:

	1. coerce attributes
	2. store images


(1) Your images are already imported.  The Importer should now coerce 
the data in preparation for export. New information for patient IVORY^I 
comes from the response to the MWL query. (This is the "correct" worklist entry.)

(2) After coercing attributes as required, store the entire study (all imported 
images) to the MESA Image Manager.
