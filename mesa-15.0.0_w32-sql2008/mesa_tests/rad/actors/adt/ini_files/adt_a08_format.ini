# This file defines any local restrictions on fields of HL7 segments
#
# This file includes segment names enclosed in brackets, [], followed by
# field-restriction definitions.  These definitions may be local in scope
# and may not apply to HL7 in general.  For example:
# patient's sex may consist of M for male and F for Female in one system,
# whereas, another system may define # them as 0 and 1 respectively.
# The format for definition is:
#
# Fld#.Comp#.Sub#, Format = <format>, PV = <PV1:PV2:PV3>;
#
# where Fld# = Field Number, Comp# = Component #,
# and Sub# = Sub Component Number.  They must be separated by periods.
#
#       <format> defines the format of the value and
#       <PV1:PV2:PV3> are possible values (only) that the field can take
#		(eg. sex = 'M' or 'F'), with
#         each value being separated by a ':'.
#
# Format: This can be defined with the help of the following characters:
#         $ - a character following this symbol may repeat itself
#         X - alphanumeric
#         # - numeric only
#         any other character means a literal.  For example '.' means that
#		there should be a period at this position.
# Example: XXX$0### means 3 alphanumerics followed by any number of 0s followed by 3 numerics.
