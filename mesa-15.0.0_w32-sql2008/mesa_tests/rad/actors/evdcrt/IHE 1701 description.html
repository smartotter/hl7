<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Description
of 1701 test, system under test is Evidence Creator</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The 1701 test is an implementation of the steps described in
Figure 14.2-1 in IHE TF I.  It simulates a typical, error-free
Evidence Document creation process in the Scheduled Workflow profile.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Getting
Started</FONT></FONT></P>

	for database configuration.</P>

	directory),</P>

</OL>
<P>    where 1701 is the test number and 4 is the verbosity level. 
The 's' flag specifies that this is a self-test.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Major
differences between my implementation and original implementation</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>One change I made was to the way that servers are started.  They
are started, stopped and reset from the mesa_servers.pl script with
no other script files required; this script reads the evdcrt_test.cfg
file to determine parameters.</P>
<P>All files are created in their own directories as described below,
to keep them from polluting the main directory. 
</P>
<P>Finally, the scripts can be started from any directory and detect
the directory they are in to properly traverse the directory
structure.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Directory
structure and files</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The &ldquo;root&rdquo; directory of the test is
testdata/y3_actor/actors/evdcrt.  The main script which runs the show
is found in scripts/evdcrt_swf.pl.  This script reads the file
1701.txt, which is found in
testdata/y3_actor/actors/common/1701/1701.txt.</P>
<P>For the time being, all auxillary data files are in the 1701
directory of the root script directory.  There are two subdirectries
there, data and results.  The idea is that all the pre-made data
files necessary to run things are found in the data, and all created
files are in results, according then to the transaction.  Perhaps
there is a better way of doing this, though.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Caveat
about directory structure</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>A number of transactions have the source and result directories
hard-coded.  This ought to be fixed.  Passing all the source and
result directories in the 1701.txt file is problematic especially for
transactions which rely on data from a number of directories (such as
any transactions which make use of the output of mod_generatestudy,
which is just about most of them).  Perhaps a global configuration
file, along with required and unique parameters on a per-transaction
basis, would be better.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Servers

<P>These are the servers which are started and controlled by the
mesa_servers.pl script for this test:</P>

issues</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The mapping between AE Title and host/port needed for Cmove is in
the imgmgr database.  Edit the file
<I>$MESA_TARGET/db/loaddicomapp.pgsql</I> and then run,</P>
<P>	psql imgmgr &lt; loaddicomapp.pgsql</P>
<P>An error such as, &ldquo;170012 Illegal service parameter: :0&rdquo;
is indicative of a bad AE Title -&gt; host/port mapping.</P>

are the ones which then come back in step 16.</P>
<P>The MPPS which needs to be created is defined in Table F.7.2-1 of
the DICOM documentation, Part 4; Table A-2.1 of IHE TF II lists
additional comments and clarifications for this table.  The
definition of the MPPS object is in the file T20MPPS.txt; various
fields are filled in from the image x1.dcm, and the report, which has
already been constructed and is found in 1701/data/sr/sr.dcm (and
which is created from $MESA_ROOT/testdata/y3_actor/sr/sr_601mr.txt)</P>

instance UID comes from the output of mesa_identifier program.</P>

it.  A new SOP Instance UID is created with the mesa_identifier call,

Manager.</P>
<P>The datasets which will be used for Transaction 10 for the naction

<P><B>21</B> Uses Nset to send a Creator Procedure Step Completed. 
The object is constructed from the template T21MPPS.txt, with the end
time and date fields filled in.  The Instance UID is that generated
by mod_generatestudy in transaction 4a and matches that of the MPPS
in transaction 21.</P>
<P><B>10</B> Uses Naction to send Storage Commitment MPPS.  Object is
constructed based on a template (found in the T10 code), with various
elements filled in with values from the structured report sent in
Transaction 43.</P>
<P>An Nevent is then sent from the image manager to the workstation.</P>
