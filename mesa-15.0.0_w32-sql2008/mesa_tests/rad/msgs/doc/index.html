<h3>
IHE/MESA Message Sequences</h3>
The IHE/MESA tests are based on message sequences that exercise features
of the IHE Technical Framework.&nbsp; We have defined different sequences
of messages and labeled them 101, 102, etc.&nbsp; In most of the cases,
we expect the actors under test to follow the sequences exactly as documented.&nbsp;
For example, it is common to think of a registration message (ADT), request
for procedure (ORM) and a scheduling message (ORM) in that order.
<p>In some cases, we document a message sequence, but the tests will allow
slight deviations.&nbsp; An example of this would be the sequence of MPPS
messages, C-Store events and Storage Commitment requests produced by a
modality.&nbsp; The modality may perform some of these actions in a sequence
that is different from the MESA documented sequence.&nbsp; The MESA tests
should allow for reasonable deviations.
<p>The documents/links below are provided to show the entire message sequence
involving all actors.&nbsp; The tests for your actor may include a subset
of the messages documented below.&nbsp; Corrections for typos are welcome.&nbsp;
If we have contrived a message sequence that does not make sense clinically,
we would especially like to hear your comments.
