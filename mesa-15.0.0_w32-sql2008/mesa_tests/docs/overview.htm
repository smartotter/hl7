Introduction</h4>
The Medical Enterprise Simulators and Analyzers (MESA) system is designed
in response to a joint effort by the RSNA and HIMSS called Integrating
the Healthcare Environment (IHE).&nbsp; The RSNA and HIMSS have convened
a group of industry experts who have produced the IHE Technical Framework
which describes how to use existing standards (HL7, DICOM) to achieve IHE
goals.&nbsp; These industry experts (the IHE Technical Committee) also
provide guidance to the RSNA and HIMSS about how to best achieve the technical
goals of the IHE program.
<p>One of the recommendations of the IHE Technical Committee was to call
for an implementation of DICOM and HL7 software (applications and services).&nbsp;
A set of simulators which would communicate according to the IHE Technical
Framework and provide message validation was defined by the IHE Technical
Committee.&nbsp; Each simulator was defined as a common component in a
hospital enterprise (an HIS, a RIS).&nbsp; Each component would follow
the IHE Technical Framework and provide validation of messages received
from peer applications.
<p>The MESA system is divided into four component areas as described in
the table below.&nbsp; MESA developers may contribute to all of the areas
listed in the table.&nbsp; End users will likely be interested in a subset
of the software.

<h4>
Simulator and Tests System Overview</h4>

<p><br>The Simulators and Test Systems consist of a number of command-line
driven applications, input data files (both text and binary) and perl scripts.&nbsp;
The Simulators and Test Systems have no graphical user interfaces at this
time.&nbsp; The perl scripts which are used to construct the test data
and drive the test procedures are the glue that holds the system together.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Display Consistency</h4>
The IHE&nbsp;Year 2 project added hardcopy/softcopy display consistency.&nbsp;
Test tools and test plans were developed under a separate contract and
are an extension of the OFFIS&nbsp;DICOMScope software.&nbsp; Those tools
are maintained by OFFIS, and we are grateful for their contribution.
